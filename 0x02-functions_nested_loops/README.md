1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game<br>
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.<br>
    - Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
    - You can only use _putchar twice in your code
 
 2. 10 x alphabet <br>
Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.<br>
    - Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
    - You can only use _putchar twice in your code
